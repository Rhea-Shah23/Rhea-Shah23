## Currently Building: 

### [ARGreeksLab](https://github.com/Rhea-Shah23/ARGreeksLab): iOS + ARKit App Development
* Visualizes Black-Scholes as something you can walk around
* Ideally an internal tool meant to develop intuition
* Turns options prices and greeks into interactive 3D surfaces in augmented reality 

### Atha: Your phone's second brain, never forget another text message ever again 
* Startup
* Dashboard of user's messages with actionable items, ideas, and any other important information
* Context-aware notification: location-based, time-based, person-based

## Notable Projects: 

### 2024 NeurIPS Spotlight Project: [Advancing Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis Using Vision Transformers](https://github.com/Rhea-Shah23/DiabeticRetinopathyResearch)
* Engineered a Vision Transformer in PyTorchLightning for 5-class diabetic retinopathy diagnosis using the RetinaMNIST dataset
* Deployed patch embeddings, self-attention, and positional encodings to capture spatial-retinal patterns with high accuracy
* Surpassed all published benchmarks, including Google AutoML Vision, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark

### [Distributed Real-Time Risk Engine for Crypto Derivatives](https://github.com/Rhea-Shah23/CryptoRiskEngine)
* Built a real-time risk engine in Rust to compute PnL, exposure, and liquidation metrics for high-frequency crypto derivatives trading
* Integrated Kafka and TimescaleDB to support millisecond latency data ingestion and scalable time-series risk aggregation
* Deployed Grafana dashboards to monitor system-wide financial health, enabling sub-second insights for automated trading decisions

### [3D-Printing Failure Detection: Comparative Analysis Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/Rhea-Shah23/3DPrintingFailure)
* Partnered with MIT Lincoln Laboratories
* Engineered a deep learning pipeline to classify 3D printing failures using a curated 10K-image subset of the CAXTON dataset
* Benchmarked ResNet, ViT, and Swin models with ResNet50 achieving 89% accuracy
* Used feature extraction to cut model size by 99.9%
* Resolved data quality issues and conducted model analysis to inform autonomous defect detection in additive manufacturing
