## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science, passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI/ML to solve real-world problems. 

I thrive at the intersection of research, engineering, and problem solving. 

With experience spanning from academic research (MIT Lincoln Lab, Northwestern) to teaching large groups of students, I bring both technical depth and collaborative leadership to every project.
